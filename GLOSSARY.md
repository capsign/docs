# Glossary

## A

**AWS EKS**
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service - Managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS.

**Auto-scaling**
Automatic adjustment of compute resources based on current demand to maintain performance and optimize costs.

## B

**Beacon Chain**
The consensus layer of Ethereum 2.0 that coordinates validators and manages proof-of-stake consensus.

**Blockchain Node**
A computer that maintains a copy of the blockchain and participates in the network by validating transactions.

## C

**Consensus Client**
Software that implements the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in Ethereum 2.0 (e.g., Prysm, Lighthouse).

**Container Orchestration**
Automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications using platforms like Kubernetes.

## D

**DynamoDB**
AWS's managed NoSQL database service used for Terraform state locking in CapSign infrastructure.

## E

**Execution Client**
Software that processes transactions and maintains the execution layer of Ethereum (e.g., Reth, Geth).

**EKS Cluster**
A managed Kubernetes cluster running on Amazon Web Services infrastructure.

## F

**Finalization**
The process by which blocks become irreversible in a proof-of-stake blockchain system.

## G

**Grafana**
Open-source analytics and monitoring platform used for visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.

## H

**Helm Chart**
A collection of files that describe Kubernetes resources and can be packaged and deployed as a unit.

**High Availability**
System design that ensures continuous operation and minimal downtime through redundancy and failover mechanisms.

## I

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes.

**Ingress Controller**
Kubernetes component that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

## J

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**
Compact, URL-safe token format used for secure authentication between Ethereum execution and consensus clients.

## K

**kubectl**
Command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters and managing containerized applications.

**Kubernetes**
Open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of applications.

## L

**Layer 2 (L2)**
Secondary blockchain frameworks built on top of existing blockchains to improve scalability and reduce costs.

**Load Balancer**
Component that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance.

## M

**Mainnet**
The primary public blockchain network where real transactions occur and have economic value.

**Monitoring Stack**
Collection of tools (Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager) used to observe and alert on system performance.

## N

**Node Group**
Collection of Amazon EC2 instances that serve as worker nodes in an EKS cluster.

**Network Policy**
Kubernetes specification that controls traffic flow between pods and external endpoints at the network layer.

## O

**Optimism**
Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses optimistic rollups to increase transaction throughput and reduce costs.

**Operator**
Kubernetes controller that extends the platform's functionality to manage complex applications automatically.

## P

**Pod**
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers sharing storage and network.

**Prometheus**
Open-source monitoring system with dimensional data model and flexible query language.

**Prysm**
Ethereum 2.0 consensus client implementation written in Go, known for its performance and user-friendly interface.

## Q

**Quality of Service (QoS)**
Kubernetes feature that manages resource allocation and prioritization for pods based on their requirements.

## R

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
Security mechanism that restricts system access based on the roles of individual users or services.

**Reth**
High-performance Ethereum execution client written in Rust, designed for speed and efficiency.

**Rollup**
Layer 2 scaling technique that bundles multiple transactions into a single transaction on the main blockchain.

## S

**Spot Instance**
Amazon EC2 instance that uses spare computing capacity at significantly reduced costs but may be interrupted.

**Staking**
Process of participating in proof-of-stake consensus by locking up cryptocurrency to help secure the network.

**StatefulSet**
Kubernetes workload API object used to manage stateful applications with persistent identity and storage.

## T

**Terraform**
Infrastructure as Code tool that allows you to define cloud resources using declarative configuration files.

**Testnet**
Test blockchain network used for development and testing without using real cryptocurrency.

## V

**Validator**
Node in a proof-of-stake network that proposes and validates new blocks in exchange for rewards.

**VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
Isolated section of AWS cloud where you can launch resources in a defined virtual network.

## W

**Worker Node**
Machine in a Kubernetes cluster that runs containerized applications and is managed by the control plane.

## Y

**YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**
Human-readable data serialization standard commonly used for configuration files in Kubernetes and Helm.

## Types of Documents

You can sign any document type:

## Signing Process

### Step 1: Access Documents

1. Log in to CapSign
2. Navigate to **Documents**
3. You'll see:
   - **Pending**: Documents awaiting your signature
   - **Signed**: Documents you've signed
   - **Drafts**: Documents you're preparing

### Step 2: Review Document

When a document needs your signature:

1. Click on the document
2. Review the full content:
   - Read entire document carefully
   - Check all terms and conditions
   - Verify parties involved
   - Note any important dates or obligations

**Important**: Only sign documents you've read and understand.

### Step 3: Verify Your Attestations

Before signing, confirm you meet requirements:

1. Document may require specific attestations:
   - Identity verification (KYC)
   - Accredited investor status
   - Geographic requirements
   - Age verification
   - Professional credentials

2. Your attestations are automatically checked
3. If missing required attestations:
   - You'll be notified
   - Must obtain attestation first
   - Return to sign after verification

### Step 4: Sign the Document

To sign:

1. Click **Sign Document**
2. Review signing details:
   - Document hash (cryptographic fingerprint)
   - Your wallet address
   - Timestamp
   - Required attestations
3. Confirm you agree to document terms
4. Authenticate with biometric (Face ID/Touch ID)
5. Signature submitted to blockchain

### Step 5: Confirmation

After signing:

1. **Immediate Confirmation**:
   - Signature recorded on blockchain
   - Transaction hash provided
   - Document marked as signed

2. **Signed Document**:
   - Access from **Documents** → **Signed**
   - Download signed copy
   - View signature details
   - Share verification link

3. **Notification**:
   - Email confirmation sent
   - Other parties notified
   - Document moves to signed folder

## Multi-Party Signatures

### Sequential Signing

Documents requiring multiple signatures:

1. **Order matters**:
   - Each party signs in specified order
   - Can't sign until previous party completes
   - Status shows who's signed and who's pending

2. **Your Role**:
   - Wait for your turn if not first
   - Receive notification when it's your turn
   - Sign when all prior signatures complete

3. **Tracking**:
   - View all signers and status
   - See who's signed and who's pending
   - Get notified when all signatures complete

### Parallel Signing

For documents allowing simultaneous signing:

- All parties can sign at any time
- No specific order required
- Document finalized when all sign
- Each signature is independent

## Understanding Signatures

### What Gets Signed

When you sign a document on CapSign:

1. **Document Hash**:
   - Cryptographic fingerprint of document
   - Any change to document changes the hash
   - Proves document hasn't been altered

2. **Your Signature**:
   - Created using your passkey
   - Unique to you and this document
   - Verifiable by anyone

3. **Metadata**:
   - Timestamp of signing
   - Your wallet address
   - Required attestations
   - Transaction details

### What's Recorded On-Chain

Stored on the blockchain:

- Document hash
- Signer's wallet address
- Signature
- Timestamp
- Attestation references

**NOT stored on-chain**:
- Document content
- Personal information
- Private details

This preserves privacy while enabling verification.

## 🔄 **Price Stability Mechanisms**

### **Enterprise Pricing Protection**

**Problem**: Token volatility affects enterprise budgeting
**Solution**: Multiple stability mechanisms

1. **📊 30-Day Moving Average**
   - Service prices based on 30-day CMX price average
   - Reduces short-term volatility impact
   - Provides predictable billing

2. **🔒 7-Day Price Locks**
   - Lock CMX/USD rate for 7 days when purchasing
   - Enterprise budget certainty
   - Optional longer locks for annual contracts

### **Volatility Management**

```
🛡️ Price Protection Example:

Month 1: CMX = $1.00, Service = 2,000 CMX
Month 2: CMX = $1.50 (+50% spike)
├── Without protection: 1,333 CMX (33% price increase)
├── With 30-day average: 1,800 CMX (10% increase)

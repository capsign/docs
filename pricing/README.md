## CapSign Token Utility & Discounts

### Why Pay with CapSign Tokens?

1. **💰 Cost Savings**: 20% discount on all services
2. **🔒 Token Utility**: Direct use case drives CMX value across entire network
3. **🎯 Ecosystem Alignment**: Support the CapSign ecosystem and open standards
4. **📈 Network Effects**: More applications on CMX Network increase token demand

### Token Payment Mechanism

**How CMX Payments Work:**

1. **Choose CMX payment** for automatic 20% discount
2. **Pay USD equivalent** ($4,000 instead of $5,000 for managed service)
3. **Automatic conversion** to CMX at current market rate
4. **Service payment** processed in CMX tokens
5. **No CMX holding required** - conversion happens just-in-time

**Benefits:**

- **Predictable USD budgeting** - you know exactly what you'll pay
- **Automatic 20% savings** without price volatility risk
- **No token management** required unless you want to hold CMX for investment
- **Simple billing** - just like any other service payment

### How to Acquire CMX Tokens

**For Service Payments:** No advance acquisition needed - automatic just-in-time conversion when you choose CMX payment option.

**For Investment/Holding (Optional):**

1. **Enterprise Treasury Sales**: Direct purchases from CapSign Inc. with full compliance documentation
2. **Private Sale Warrants**: Limited allocation (5% of supply) for strategic investors  
3. **Secondary Market Trading**: Once listed on exchanges (future)
4. **Node Operator Rewards**: Earn CMX through network validation participation

**Benefits of This Model:**

- **Complete regulatory compliance** and paper trail documentation
- **No forced token holding** for service usage - pay when you need it
- **Investment flexibility** - hold CMX if you believe in network growth
- **Genuine utility** - tokens have real use cases beyond speculation

**Legal Clarity:** CMX has genuine utility (service payments, network gas fees, governance) and operates similar to other established utility tokens like ETH, BTC, and XRP. Holding tokens for investment purposes doesn't change their fundamental utility nature.

- **Common standards** for all capital markets operations
- **Unified token utility** (CST) across all network applications

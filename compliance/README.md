# Compliance Framework

CapSign's compliance framework integrates traditional regulatory requirements with blockchain technology to create a transparent, immutable, and decentralized compliance system. By leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), CapSign provides a secure and verifiable method for maintaining regulatory compliance across digital asset offerings.

## Executive Summary

CapSign's compliance framework represents a paradigm shift in regulatory compliance for digital assets. By leveraging blockchain technology through the Ethereum Attestation Service and purpose-built attestation schemas, we enable:

- **Reduced compliance costs** through reusable attestations
- **Enhanced privacy** through cryptographic verification
- **Improved regulatory confidence** through immutable records
- **Streamlined investment processes** while maintaining strict compliance standards

This framework provides the foundation for a more efficient, secure, and accessible financial system that meets or exceeds traditional compliance requirements while embracing the possibilities of decentralized technology.

## üèóÔ∏è Decentralized Compliance Architecture

### Ethereum Attestation Service Integration

CapSign utilizes the Ethereum Attestation Service as the foundation for its decentralized compliance infrastructure. This approach offers several key advantages:

#### Core Benefits

1. **Immutable Verification Records**: All compliance attestations are recorded on-chain, creating a permanent, tamper-proof record of verification.

2. **Decentralized Validation**: Compliance checks can be independently verified without relying on central authorities.

3. **Portable Credentials**: Once verified, attestations can be used across compatible platforms without requiring re-verification.

4. **Privacy-Preserving**: Only cryptographic proofs of attestations are shared, keeping sensitive personal information secure.

#### Technical Implementation

```solidity
// Example Attestation Schema
struct ComplianceAttestation {
    bytes32 schemaUID;
    address attester;
    address recipient;
    uint64 time;
    uint64 expirationTime;
    bool revocable;
    bytes32 refUID;
    bytes data;
}
```

#### Integration Benefits

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Attestations work across the broader Ethereum ecosystem
- **Standardized Verification**: Common standards for compliance verification
- **Reduced Friction**: One-time verification for multiple platforms
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets or exceeds traditional compliance requirements

## üìä Attestation Schema Framework

The CapSign compliance system is built around three core attestation schemas that work together to provide comprehensive compliance coverage:

### 1. Customer Identification Schema

This schema captures essential KYC/AML elements while maintaining user privacy:

#### Data Elements

- **Identity verification** (government-issued ID validation)
- **Address verification** (proof of residence)
- **Risk assessment indicators** (automated scoring)
- **PEP screening results** (Politically Exposed Person status)
- **Sanctions screening status** (OFAC and international lists)
- **Verification timestamps and expiration dates**

#### Privacy Protection

Each attestation is linked to a wallet address, creating a verifiable on-chain record that the owner has completed the required identification process without exposing personal information.

#### Technical Schema

```json
{
  "name": "Customer Identification",
  "description": "KYC/AML verification attestation",
  "schema": "bool kyc_verified, bool aml_cleared, uint8 risk_score, uint64 verification_date, uint64 expiration_date, string jurisdiction"
}
```

### 2. Investor Qualification Schema

This schema addresses accreditation requirements and investment eligibility:

#### Qualification Types

- **Accreditation status** (accredited vs. non-accredited)
- **Qualification criteria met** (income, net worth, professional certification)
- **Investment limits** based on regulatory categorization
- **Verification method used** (documentation type)
- **Attestation validity period** (expiration timeline)
- **Jurisdictional qualifications** (geographic restrictions)

#### Regulatory Compliance

These attestations enable compliant participation in regulated offerings without repeatedly sharing sensitive financial information.

#### Technical Schema

```json
{
  "name": "Investor Qualification",
  "description": "Accreditation and eligibility verification",
  "schema": "bool accredited, uint256 investment_limit, string qualification_type, uint64 verification_date, uint64 expiration_date, string[] jurisdictions"
}
```

### 3. Investor Jurisdiction Schema

This schema handles the complex requirements of cross-border compliance:

#### Geographic Elements

- **Residency jurisdiction(s)** (legal residence)
- **Tax jurisdiction(s)** (tax obligations)
- **Regulatory restrictions** applicable to the investor
- **Jurisdictional investment permissions** (allowed investment types)
- **Geographic restrictions** (blocked countries/regions)
- **Compliance with local securities laws**
- **Jurisdictional transfer limitations** (cross-border restrictions)

#### Cross-Border Compliance

Enables compliant international investment while respecting local regulations and restrictions.

#### Technical Schema

```json
{
  "name": "Investor Jurisdiction",
  "description": "Geographic and regulatory jurisdiction verification",
  "schema": "string[] residence_jurisdictions, string[] tax_jurisdictions, string[] restrictions, bool[] investment_permissions, uint64 verification_date"
}
```

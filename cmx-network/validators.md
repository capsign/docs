# Validator Guide

CMX Network is built on the **Optimism Stack**, which uses a different validation model than traditional proof-of-stake networks. Currently, validator nodes are **not yet available** for public participation, but we have plans for decentralized validation in the future.

## Current Network Status

### Centralized Sequencer (Current)

**CapSign-Operated Infrastructure**:
- **Centralized Sequencer** - CapSign operates the transaction ordering and block production
- **Fraud Proof System** - Community can challenge invalid state transitions
- **Ethereum Security** - Inherits full Ethereum mainnet security guarantees
- **Enterprise Focus** - Optimized for institutional requirements and compliance

**Why Centralized Initially**:
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Easier to meet capital markets regulatory requirements
- **Performance Guarantees** - Predictable performance for enterprise customers
- **Rapid Development** - Faster iteration and feature development
- **Quality Control** - Ensure high-quality service delivery during early phases

### Fraud Proof Validation (Available Now)

While traditional validators aren't available, anyone can participate in **fraud proof validation**:

**What is Fraud Proof Validation**:
- **Challenge Invalid Transactions** - Anyone can dispute incorrect state transitions
- **7-Day Challenge Period** - Window to submit fraud proofs for withdrawals
- **Economic Incentives** - Rewards for successful fraud proof challenges
- **No Staking Required** - Participation without locking up CMX tokens

**How to Participate**:
1. **Monitor Network Activity** - Watch for suspicious transactions or state changes
2. **Run Fraud Proof Software** - Use OP Stack tools to detect invalid states
3. **Submit Challenges** - File fraud proofs during the challenge window
4. **Earn Rewards** - Receive compensation for successful challenges

## Future Validator Program

### Planned Decentralization Roadmap

**Phase 1: Enhanced Fraud Proofs (6-12 months)**
- Improved fraud proof mechanisms and tooling
- Community rewards program for fraud proof participation
- Enhanced monitoring and detection systems

**Phase 2: Decentralized Sequencing (12-18 months)**
- **Multi-Sequencer Network** - Transition to decentralized sequencer rotation
- **KYC'd Sequencers** - Verified operators meeting compliance requirements
- **Economic Incentives** - CMX token rewards for sequencer operation
- **Slashing Conditions** - Penalties for malicious sequencer behavior

**Phase 3: Full Validator Network (18-24 months)**
- **Open Validator Participation** - Public validator node operation
- **Staking Requirements** - CMX token staking for validator participation
- **Governance Integration** - Validator voting on network parameters
- **Enterprise Validator Pools** - Institutional validator services

### Validator Requirements (Future)

When validator nodes become available, requirements will include:

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Hardware Specifications** - Minimum compute, memory, and storage requirements
- **Network Connectivity** - High-speed, low-latency internet connection
- **Uptime Standards** - 99.9% uptime requirements with penalties for downtime
- **Security Standards** - Secure key management and infrastructure

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **KYC Verification** - All validators must complete identity verification
- **Jurisdiction Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements in operating jurisdiction
- **Sanctions Screening** - Pass ongoing sanctions and AML screening
- **Legal Agreements** - Sign validator service agreements and terms

**Economic Requirements**:
- **Minimum Stake** - 100,000 CMX tokens required for validator participation
- **Performance Bond** - Additional stake for guaranteed service levels
- **Slashing Conditions** - Token penalties for malicious behavior or downtime
- **Insurance Requirements** - Professional liability insurance for institutional validators

## Validator Economics (Planned)

### Revenue Opportunities

**Block Production Rewards**:
- **Base Rewards** - Fixed CMX rewards per block produced
- **Transaction Fees** - Share of gas fees collected from transactions
- **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** - Revenue from transaction ordering
- **Service Fees** - Portion of CapSign service revenue sharing

**Estimated Returns**:
- **Annual Yield** - 8-12% estimated return for active validators
- **Performance Bonuses** - Additional rewards for high uptime and performance
- **Governance Rewards** - Extra incentives for governance participation
- **Enterprise Contracts** - Premium pricing for dedicated enterprise services

### Costs and Risks

**Operational Costs**:
- **Hardware and Infrastructure** - Server costs, electricity, maintenance
- **Compliance Costs** - KYC, legal, and regulatory compliance expenses
- **Insurance Premiums** - Professional liability and cyber security insurance
- **Technical Support** - 24/7 monitoring and technical staff

**Risk Factors**:
- **Slashing Risk** - Potential loss of staked tokens for violations
- **Regulatory Risk** - Changes in regulatory requirements
- **Technical Risk** - Software bugs, hardware failures, security breaches
- **Market Risk** - CMX token price volatility affecting returns

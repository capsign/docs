# Wallets

CapSign wallets are smart contract wallets (ERC-4337) that use biometric authentication instead of seed phrases.

## What is a Smart Wallet?

A smart wallet is a smart contract on the blockchain that acts as your account. Unlike traditional wallets (EOAs), smart wallets offer:

- **Flexible authentication** - Passkeys for individuals, EOA signers for entities
- **Account abstraction** - Better UX with gasless transactions
- **Programmable** - Support for multi-sig, spending limits, and recovery
- **Secure** - Biometric or existing wallet authentication

### Individual Accounts

**Passkey-controlled:**
- No seed phrases - controlled by Face ID / Touch ID
- Biometric authentication required for all actions
- Non-custodial and user-controlled

### Entity Accounts

**EOA-controlled via EIP-1193:**
- Use existing wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Fireblocks, etc.)
- Compatible with current workflows (MPC, multi-sig, custodians)
- Sign transactions with connected wallet
- Smart account executes after EOA signature

## Key Features

### Authentication Methods

**Individual Accounts (Passkeys):**
- **Face ID** (iOS, Mac)
- **Touch ID** (iOS, Mac)
- **Fingerprint** (Android)
- **Windows Hello** (Windows)

Every transaction requires biometric confirmation - no one can access your wallet without your biometrics.

**Entity Accounts (EIP-1193 EOA Owners):**
- **MetaMask** - Browser extension wallet
- **Coinbase Wallet** - Mobile and browser wallet
- **Fireblocks** - Institutional custody and MPC
- **Ledger/Trezor** - Hardware wallets
- **Multi-sig** - Safe, Gnosis, etc.

Entities sign with their existing wallet infrastructure, maintaining current security practices.

### Multi-Entity Support

Switch between multiple organizational contexts from a single account:

- **Personal Account** - Your individual investment account
- **Corporate Accounts** - Company investment accounts you're authorized for
- **Fund Accounts** - Investment funds and SPVs you manage
- **Multiple Roles** - GP in Fund A, LP in Fund B, employee of Corp C

### Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)

Your wallet uses ERC-4337 account abstraction:

- **Gas sponsorship** - Platform can sponsor gas for certain operations
- **Batch transactions** - Execute multiple actions in one transaction
- **Custom validation** - Flexible signature schemes (passkeys, multi-sig)
- **UserOperations** - Transactions submitted through bundlers

### Security Features

- **Biometric-only access** - No seed phrases to lose or steal
- **On-chain verification** - All actions verified by smart contract
- **Replay protection** - Signatures can't be reused
- **Domain separation** - Signatures bound to specific contracts

## Account Recovery

### Account Recovery

**Individual Accounts:**

Your passkey is stored in your device's secure enclave and synced via:
- **iCloud Keychain** (Apple devices)
- **Google Password Manager** (Android devices)
- **Windows Hello** (Windows devices)

If you lose your device, you can recover access on a new device signed into the same account.

**Entity Accounts:**

Recovery handled by your existing wallet:
- **MetaMask** - Your seed phrase recovery
- **Fireblocks** - Your institution's backup policies
- **Multi-sig** - Recover via other signers
- **Hardware wallet** - Your hardware device backup

### Social Recovery

## Multi-Entity Management

CapSign supports complex organizational structures through context switching:

**Example use cases:**
- Fund manager with multiple SPVs
- Employee with corporate investment account
- LP in multiple funds
- GP and LP in different funds

## Advanced Features

### Delegation

Coming soon: Delegate transaction permissions to other wallets (e.g., allow an employee to sign documents on behalf of the company).

### Multi-Signature

Coming soon: Require multiple signatures for certain operations (e.g., company treasury requires 2 of 3 executives).

### Spending Limits

Coming soon: Set daily or per-transaction spending limits for added security.

## Technical Details

### Contract Architecture

CapSign wallets use the Diamond Pattern (EIP-2535):

- **Modular facets** - Functionality split into separate contracts
- **Upgradeable** - New features can be added without changing the wallet address
- **Gas efficient** - Singleton pattern reduces deployment costs

## FAQs

**Q: Can I use my own wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)?**
A: Yes! Entity accounts use your existing wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Fireblocks, etc.) as the signer via EIP-1193. Individual accounts use passkey-controlled smart wallets.

**Q: Where are my private keys?**
A: For individual accounts, your wallet is controlled by a passkey stored in your device's secure enclave (no traditional private keys). For entity accounts, private keys are in your connected wallet (MetaMask, Fireblocks, etc.).

**Q: What if I lose my device?**
A: For individual accounts, your passkey syncs via iCloud Keychain (Apple) or Google Password Manager (Android). For entity accounts, recover via your connected wallet's backup method (seed phrase, MPC backup, multi-sig, etc.).

**Q: Can someone steal my wallet if they steal my device?**
A: For individual accounts, no - biometric authentication is required and biometrics can't be extracted. For entity accounts, security depends on your connected wallet's protection (password, hardware device, etc.).

**Q: What networks are supported?**
A: Base Mainnet and Base Sepolia testnet. See [Supported Networks](/reference/supported-networks.md).

**Q: Can I use Fireblocks or other institutional custody?**
A: Yes! Entity accounts work with any EIP-1193 compatible wallet, including Fireblocks, BitGo, Anchorage, and other institutional custodians.

**Q: Does this work with my existing MPC setup?**
A: Yes. Entity accounts use your existing wallet infrastructure. If you use MPC wallets (Fireblocks, Qredo, etc.), they work seamlessly as the EOA owner.

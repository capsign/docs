# Self-Hosted CMX Protocol

**Deploy the CMX Protocol in your own environment with complete control - from simple node deployment to enterprise-grade infrastructure.**

## What Is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting means running the CMX Protocol stack in your own environment. You have two main options:

### üÜì **Open Source Deployment** (Free)

Deploy the CMX Protocol however you want using our open-source components:

- **CMX geth node** from GitHub - The core blockchain client
- **Connect to Ethereum L1** - Attach to any Ethereum node
- **Your infrastructure** - Use any cloud, on-premise, or hybrid setup
- **Community support** - GitHub issues and Discord community

### üèóÔ∏è **Recommended Architecture** (Battle-Tested)

Use CapSign's production-ready infrastructure blueprints:

- **Terraform modules** - AWS VPC, EKS, security configurations
- **Kubernetes Helm charts** - Production-ready deployment manifests
- **Monitoring stack** - Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager
- **Security hardening** - SOC compliance configurations
- **Step-by-step guides** - From setup to production operations

## Core Requirements (All Deployments)

Regardless of how you deploy, every CMX Protocol deployment needs:

### Essential Components

1. **CMX geth node** - Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/capsign/cmx-geth)
2. **Ethereum L1 connection** - Mainnet, Sepolia, or your preferred testnet
3. **Database storage** - For blockchain state and transaction data
4. **Network connectivity** - P2P networking for blockchain sync

### Basic Architecture

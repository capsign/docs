# CMX Protocol

The CMX Protocol is a comprehensive capital markets blockchain infrastructure providing enterprise-grade smart contracts for tokenized securities, asset management, trading, and regulatory compliance. Built with regulatory compliance and institutional-grade security at its core.

## Architecture Overview

The CMX Protocol uses a **diamond-based architecture** (EIP-2535) for maximum upgradability and modularity while maintaining security and regulatory compliance.

### Core Components

- **üèõÔ∏è Diamond Architecture** - Modular, upgradeable smart contracts
- **üîê Access Management** - Enterprise-grade permission system
- **üìã Attestation System** - Identity verification and compliance
- **üíé Asset Tokenization** - Securities and RWA tokenization
- **üìä Trading Markets** - Multiple trading venue types
- **‚öñÔ∏è Governance** - Corporate governance and voting mechanisms
- **üìö Document Management** - Secure document storage and verification
- **üí∞ Payment Systems** - Gas abstraction and billing
- **üìñ Accounting Ledgers** - Double-entry bookkeeping
- **üè¶ Fund Management** - Investment fund operations

## Key Features

### Regulatory Compliance First

- **Built-in KYC/AML** - Integrated identity verification
- **Securities Law Compliance** - Rule 506(b), 506(c), Rule 701 support
- **Multi-jurisdictional** - Configurable for different regulatory environments
- **Audit Trails** - Complete transaction history for regulatory reporting

### Enterprise Security

- **Diamond Architecture** - Secure upgradeable contracts
- **Role-based Access** - Granular permission system
- **Multi-signature** - Enterprise governance controls
- **Security-First Design** - Built with security best practices

### Capital Markets Focus

- **Securities Tokenization** - Equity, debt, and hybrid instruments
- **Investment Funds** - Mutual funds, hedge funds, ETFs
- **Trading Infrastructure** - Order books, auctions, OTC markets
- **Settlement Systems** - Automated clearing and settlement

## Token Standards

### ERC-7752: Lot-Based Tokens

The CMX Protocol implements **ERC-7752**, a revolutionary token standard that treats every acquisition (lot) as its own on-chain record, enabling precise capital markets compliance and accounting.

**Why Lot-Based Tokens Matter for Capital Markets:**

- **Per-Lot Cost Basis** - Every token acquisition maintains its own cost basis for accurate tax reporting
- **Regulatory Lineage** - Complete audit trail from initial issuance through all transfers
- **Compliance Controls** - Granular restrictions based on acquisition method and timing
- **Tax Reporting** - Built-in FIFO/LIFO accounting for automated regulatory filing

**Key Capital Markets Use Cases:**

| Asset Type | ERC-7752 Benefits |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Equity & Options** | Track every stock certificate or grant as individual lots with vesting metadata |
| **Debt & Convertibles** | Maintain coupon payment history and conversion lineage via parentLotId |
| **Private Securities** | Handle lock-ups, vesting schedules, and wash-sale rule compliance |
| **Fund Accounting** | Generate investor K-1s and Form 8949 reports automatically from on-chain data |

**Transfer Types for Regulatory Context:**

- `INTERNAL` - Administrative transfers between controlled wallets (typically non-taxable)
- `SALE` - Market transactions for consideration (taxable events)
- `GIFT` - Gratuitous transfers between parties (gift tax implications)
- `INHERITANCE` - Estate/probate distributions (stepped-up basis)
- `REWARD` - Airdrops, staking yields, payroll RSUs (compensation income)

**Technical Implementation:**

ERC-7752 uses a linked ERC-1155 architecture where each `tokenId` represents a unique lot with complete transaction history. This provides:

- **Efficient Auditing** - Easy tracking of any token's complete history
- **Unique Metadata** - Each transfer can have its own URI pointing to legal documents
- **Compliance Benefits** - Essential for private RWA issuers requiring detailed reporting

## Getting Started

### For Developers

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Foundry development environment
   - Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
   - Basic understanding of Solidity and Diamond patterns

2. **Installation**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/capsign/protocol.git
   cd protocol
   forge install
   ```

3. **Development Setup**

   ```bash
   # Copy environment template

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Run tests
   forge test
   ```

### For Integrators

Use the CMX Protocol SDK for easy integration:

```bash
npm install @capsign/sdk
```

```javascript
import { CMXClient, Network } from "@capsign/sdk";

const client = new CMXClient({
  network: Network.BASE_SEPOLIA,
  privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
});

// Create a tokenized asset
const asset = await client.assets.create({
  name: "Example Corp Class A",
  symbol: "EXMP-A",
  totalShares: 1000000,
});
```

## Security Considerations

### Security Status

- **Internal Review** - Ongoing internal security review and testing
- **Future Audits** - Professional security audits planned before mainnet deployment

### Best Practices

- All privileged functions use multi-signature requirements
- Role-based access control with time-delayed administrative actions
- Emergency pause mechanisms for critical functions
- Comprehensive event logging for transparency
